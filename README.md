Cisco EoL Device Migration Options - README
Project Description:

This project helps network administrators identify suitable Cisco firewall migration options for End-of-Life (EoL) devices. It offers two methods to find alternative firewalls:

Method 1: Select EoL Model

Choose your EoL model from the drop-down menu.
The table will display one or two potential replacements that closely match or exceed the EoL device's key metrics.

Method 2: Enter Custom Metrics

For more flexibility, enter desired values for key metrics (e.g., throughput, connections).
The application will display suitable alternatives based on your entered values.
Important Note: This application is intended for a general overview. For specific requirements or complex migrations, consider applying custom filters in option two or consulting with a Cisco representative.
